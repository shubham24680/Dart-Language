/*Q. Letâ€™s say you are given a list saved in a variable:
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. 
Write a Dart code that takes this list and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.*/

void main(List<String> args) {
  List<int> a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100];
  List<int> b = [];
  for (var i in a) if (i & 1 == 0) b.add(i);
  print(b);
}
